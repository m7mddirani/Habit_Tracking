#Habit Tracking Application

1. **Section Headers**: Consider using smaller section headers for better readability. For example, instead of "Installation", "Usage", "Unit Tests", and "Contributing", you can use "Installation", "Usage", "Testing", and "Contributions".

2. **Code Blocks**: Ensure that all code blocks are properly formatted with triple backticks (```). In your current README, the code blocks under "Installation" and "Usage" sections are not formatted correctly.

3. **Command Line Prompts**: In the "Usage" section, when providing command line instructions, consider using the `$` symbol to represent the command line prompt. For example:

    ```
    $ python main.py
    ```

4. **Grammar and Punctuation**: Review the grammar and punctuation throughout the README to ensure clarity and correctness. For instance, the "Features" section could be improved with bullet points and proper punctuation.

5. **License**: It's good to mention the project's license, if applicable. You can include a section at the end of the README to mention the license under which the project is distributed.

6. **Project Description**: Consider adding a brief description at the beginning of the README to introduce the project and its purpose before listing the features.

Here's a revised version incorporating these suggestions:
